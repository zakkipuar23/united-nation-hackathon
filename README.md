# United Nation Hackathon
This hackathon was held for 4 days in more than 60 countries around the world, participated by more than 1000 participants from 450 teams. 

## This hackathon's theme is : 
Using Big Data and Data Science to develop ideas and solutions to address Global Challenges and help achieve Sustainable Development Goals; notably to support policies caused by:
- The disruption to Global Value Chains and Economic Globalization due to disasters, conflicts, restrictions, blockages
- The impact of Climate Change on society as part of monitoring SDG 13
- The rise of food and energy prices affecting vicious cycles of poverty, hunger, and inequalities

### Our team objective was
Understanding the vulnerability of countries facing dengue outbreak due to climate change for a sustainable society. 

### Our submission for this hackathon was 
Create a unsupervised machine learning model and visualize the result with Power BI to show the vulnerability map

For more detail, please read about our project further from files in this repository. 
- **[PYTHON - PRIMARY] Clustering for Vulnerability Mapping** = Main python script, consist data preparation process (like dimensional reduction) and the clustering itself
- **[PYTHON - ADDITIONAL] Scraping Script for Some Data Collection** = Python script for some data collection process since some data couldnâ€™t be downloaded easily from website
- **[PYTHON - ADDITIONAL] Script for Reverse Geocoding LTS Model data** = Python script to complete 3rd process of data preparation, which is Reverse Geocoding
- **[GOOGLE SHEETS - ADDITIONAL] Dataset Compilation** = to complete 4th process of data preparation, which is Joining multiple data source
- **[POWER BI - ADDITIONAL] Exploratory Data Analysis** = Power BI file that consist some graph that we created when conduct exploratory data analysis. Some graph result is already copy into this pdf file as explanatory analysis
- **[POWER BI - PRIMARY] Vulnerability Map with Statistic Info per Country** = Power BI file that consist final dashboard. It shows vulnerability map and statistic info from each country as tooltips
