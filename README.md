# United Nation Hackathon
This hackathon was held for 4 days in more than 60 countries around the world, participated by more than 1000 participants from 450 teams. 

## This hackathon's theme is : 
Using Big Data and Data Science to develop ideas and solutions to address Global Challenges and help achieve Sustainable Development Goals; notably to support policies caused by:
- The disruption to Global Value Chains and Economic Globalization due to disasters, conflicts, restrictions, blockages
- The impact of Climate Change on society as part of monitoring SDG 13
- The rise of food and energy prices affecting vicious cycles of poverty, hunger, and inequalities

### Our team objective was
Understanding the vulnerability of countries facing dengue outbreak due to climate change for a sustainable society. 

### Our submission for this hackathon was 
Create a unsupervised machine learning model and visualize the result with Power BI to show the vulnerability map

For more detail, please read about our project further from files in this repository. 
- **[PDF - PRIMARY] Presentation of TERRAVERSE Project Regarding Dengue by Climate Change.pdf** = Main presentation material. All of things that should be explained is in here. Created by all of us, mainly designed by Rahman Fitra Perdana.
- **[PYTHON - PRIMARY] Clustering for Vulnerability Mapping** = Main python script, consist data preparation process (like dimensional reduction) and the clustering itself. Created by Insan Aprilian.
- **[PYTHON - ADDITIONAL] Scraping Script for Some Data Collection** = Python script for some data collection process since some data couldnâ€™t be downloaded easily from website. Created by Alfredo Marciano Zola.
- **[PYTHON - ADDITIONAL] Script for Reverse Geocoding LTS Model data** = Python script to complete 3rd process of data preparation, which is Reverse Geocoding. Created by Rafif Abdus Salam.
- **[GOOGLE SHEETS - ADDITIONAL] Dataset Compilation** = to complete 4th process of data preparation, which is Joining multiple data source. Created by all of team member.
- **[POWER BI - PRIMARY] Vulnerability Map with Statistic Info per Country** = Power BI file that consist final dashboard. It shows vulnerability map and statistic info from each country as tooltips. Created by me, Anugrah Muzakki Puar.
- **[POWER BI - ADDITIONAL] Exploratory Data Analysis** = Power BI file that consist some graph that we created when conduct exploratory data analysis. Some graph result is already copy into this pdf file as explanatory analysis. Mainly created by me, Anugrah Muzakki Puar.
